        <p>I’m Kyle Naumann, a coach, teacher, and parent of 3. I enjoy working with kids, families, and taking on new
            challenges in tech and design.
            With a background in education and design, I love combining creativity and problem-solving to help others
            grow and
            succeed. I love the outdoors and spending time with my family. I love Lego, Cheesecake, and everything you
            can do in the Water.</p>
